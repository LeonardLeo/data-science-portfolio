## Contents

- ### Machine Learning
	- [Unsupervised Learning: Classifying Customers Based on their Wine Preference](https://github.com/LeonardLeo/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Dimensionality%20Reduction): A model to predict the various type of customers a company has given their preference in taste to allow for classification of new customers and to recommend wine based on the class they fall into. Identified the best class that each customer falls into utilizing machine learning.
	- [Supervised Learning: Predicting the Purchase of a Product](https://github.com/LeonardLeo/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Classification): Testing out several different supervised learning classification algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual will purchase a product given his age and his estimated salary.
	- [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/LeonardLeo/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Clustering): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in spending score) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
	- [Reinforcement Learning: Selecting the best ad](https://github.com/LeonardLeo/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Reinforcement%20Learning): Creating a model that can decide for itself, the best ad a company should use for advertisement.
	- [Deep Learning: Predicting if a Customer Leaves the Bank using ANN](https://github.com/LeonardLeo/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/ANN):  Designing and implementing an Artificial Neural Network that learns to predict if a customer will leave the bank by matching patterns in the data and behaviour of other customers in the past.

	_Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib


- ### Natural Language Processing
	- [2-way Sentiment Analysis for Restaurant Reviews](https://github.com/LeonardLeo/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Machine%20Learning%20for%20Natural%20Language%20Processing/natural_language_processing.py): 2-way polarity (positive or negative) classification system for restaurant reviews, using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine. 

	_Tools: NLTK, Scikit-learn
